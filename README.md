# Income_prediction

In this Notebook, I am working through the Income Prediction problem associated with the Adult Income Census dataset.
The goal is to accurately predict whether or not someone is making more or less than $50,000 a year.

An individual’s annual income results from various factors. 
Intuitively, it is influenced by the individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc.


Target filed: Income -- The income is divide into two classes: <=50K and >50K 

Attributes: Other columns -- These are the demographics and other features to describe a person
